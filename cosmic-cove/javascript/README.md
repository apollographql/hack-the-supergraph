# Cosmic Cove - Hack the Supergraph (JavaScript)

The coves found throughout the cosmos are large and daunting. Many travelers have been lost without a map of the cavern they are exploring. That's why the Intergalactic Society of Cavern Explorers published the a datasource that let's anyone get cavern map data with just the galactic latitude and longitude of the cove. We'll use this data with a list of coves we've been wanting to explore.

## Summary

At this subgraph station, you'll be using `@requires` to require specific information from an external subgraph. In our scenario, we'll be requiring the exact location coordinates to create a map of the coves caverns. We'll use `@external` which will tell the graph router that it needs to fetch the values of those externally defined fields first, even if the original client query didn't request them.

## What you'll learn

- Using external subgraph fields using `@requires` and `@external`
- Using [rover] to publish your subgraph schema into your Supergraph
- Using [rover] to validation your subgraph schema with your Supergraph
- If you want to code...
  - Creating a new subgraph using `rover template`

## Start

For this station, the project for coves has already been put together for you. We just need to add the cavernMap data to our Cove. You can find the starting code in the `cosmic-cove-start/javascript` folder.

First, we'll need to add the appropriate [Apollo Federation directives]. Since the cavern map is going to require location information, we'll need to add `@requires`:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"âˆ‚
    import: [ "@key", "@shareable", "@requires"]
  )
```

Now we can add our `cavernMap` data to the `Cove` type and require the appropriate fields from the `location`:

```graphql
type Cove @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  location: Location
  cavernMap: [Float]
    @requires(fields: "location { celestialBody { latitude longitude } }")
}
type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  celestialBody: CelestialBody!
}
type CelestialBody @shareable {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

The `Cove` resolver has already been written for you, but you can see in `src/resolvers/Cove.js` that the `location` information we require is available on the `parent`. 

```javascript
module.exports = {
  Cove: {
    cavernMap(cove, args, context) {
      const { latitude, longitude } = cove.location.celestialBody;
      return context.coves.getCavernMap(latitude, longitude);
    }
    ...
  },
};
```

Now we can start up our subgraph and add it to our Supergraph stack locally with rover:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Uh oh... it looks like there was a problem with the schema:

It's nice that `@apollo/subgraph` has this validation, but there are also other tools in `rover` to validate a subgraph's schema.

Try running the rover command for schema validation:

```shell
rover subgraph check {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID}@main \
  --schema "./schema.graphql" \
  --name cosmic-cove \
```

Not only does this validate your schema will compose, it will also validate it against any production traffic for your Supergraph. This helps ensure we don't unknowingly break any of our clients consuming the graph ðŸŽ‰

Ideally this is something we can run in CI on every pull request. There is an example of this in the `cosmic-cove/javascript/workflows` folder; there is a similar template for any templates available in `rover template use`.

Since we are requiring the `location` field to get our `cavernMap` information, we'll need to import `@external` and add it to the `celestialBody` field:

```graphql
extend schema
@link(
  url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
  import: [ "@key", "@shareable", "@requires", "@external" ]
)
type Cove @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  location: Location
  cavernMap: [Float]
  @requires(fields: "location { celestialBody { latitude longitude } }")
}
type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  celestialBody: CelestialBody! @external
}
type CelestialBody @shareable {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

Finally, we can add this into our Supergraph by publishing it using [rover].

First, you'll need to [configure rover] for your Supergraph. Once rover is configured, we can use the `rover subgraph publish` command

```shell
rover subgraph publish {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID}@main \
  --schema "./schema.graphql" \
  --name cosmic-cove \
  --routing-url "https://cosmic-cove-production.up.railway.app/"
```

> _NOTE: make sure to replace {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID} with the id of the Supergraph you created at the start of the hackathon_

We can see our Supergraph deployment in the "Launches" tab:
