# Cosmic Cove - Hack the Supergraph

The coves found throughout the cosmos are large and daunting. Many travelers have been lost without a map of the cavern they are exploring. That's why the Intergalactic Society of Cavern Explorers published the a datasource that let's anyone get cavern map data with just the galactic latitude and longitude of the cove. We'll use this data with a list of coves we've been wanting to explore.

## I don't want to write code...

For this station, the schema for coves has already been put together for you. We just need to add the `cavernMap` data to our `Cove`:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
    import: [ "@key", "@shareable" ]
  )

type Query {
  coves: [Cove]
}

type Cove @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  location: Location
}

type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
}

type CelestialBody @shareable {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

First, we'll need to add the appropriate [Apollo Federation directives]. Since the cavern map is going to require location information, we'll need to add `@requires`:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"âˆ‚
    import: [ "@key", "@shareable", "@requires"]
  )
```

Now we can add our `cavernMap` data to the `Cove` type and require the appropriate fields from the `location`:

```graphql
type Cove @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  location: Location
  cavernMap: [Float]
    @requires(fields: "location { celestialBody { latitude longitude } }")
}
```

Finally, we can add this into our Supergraph by publishing it using [rover]. 

First, you'll need to [Configure rover] for your Supergraph. Once rover is configured, we can use the `rover subgraph publish` command

```shell
rover subgraph publish {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID}@main \
  --schema "./schema.graphql" \
  --name cosmic-cove \
  --routing-url "https://cosmic-cove-production.up.railway.app/"
```

>*NOTE: make sure to repalce {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID} with the id of the Supergraph you created at the start of the hackathon*

Uh oh...it looks like there was a problem with the schema:

We can also see the build errors in the launches tab:

![](../images/cosmic-cove-composition-errors-launches.png)

If we read through the build error, we can see that we're missing an `@external` directive since the `location` information is coming from the subgraph we created at the start of the hackathon. 

>Cannot query field "celestialBody" on type "Location" (if the field is defined in another subgraph, you need to add it to this subgraph with @external).

It's great to see that our error didn't break the Supergraph; failing builds don't cause any downtime. We can update our Supergraph by fixing the build error, but we can also check our schema is valid prior to publishing it.

Try running the rover command for schema validation:

```shell
rover subgraph check {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID}@main \
  --schema "./schema.graphql" \
  --name cosmic-cove \
```

Not only does this validate your schema will compose, it will also validate it against any productio ntraffic for your Supergraph. This helps ensure we don't unknowingly break any of our clients consuming the graph ðŸŽ‰

Since we are requiring the `location` field to get our `cavernMap` information, we'll need to import `@external` and add it to the `celestialBody` field:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"âˆ‚
    import: [ "@key", "@shareable", "@requires", "@external" ]
  )
type Cove @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  location: Location
  cavernMap: [Float]
    @requires(fields: "location { celestialBody { latitude longitude } }")
}

type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  celestialBody: CelestialBody! @external
}

type CelestialBody @shareable {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

Now let's re-publish this schema into our Supergraph:

```shell
rover subgraph publish {YOUR_SUPERGRAPH_ID}@main \
  --schema "./schema.graphql" \
  --name cosmic-cove \
  --routing-url "https://cosmic-cove-production.up.railway.app/"
```

We can see our Supergraph deployment in the "Launches" tab:
