# Hack the Supergraph (JavaScript)

We need to upgrade the `Location` type to be an entity. Below is the schema that is being used in the box:

```graphql
type Location  {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  celestialBody: CelestialBody!
}

type CelestialBody {
  galaxy: String
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
}

type Query {
  destinations: [Location]
}
```

In this folder lives the code for the Planisphere (you can think of this as our existing monolith). We'll need to make a couple changes to support Apollo Federation 2:

1. Install Apollo Federation library
2. Modify schema and resolvers to define `Location` as an entity
3. Build our schema with Apollo Federation library

Let's get started by setting up the project:

```shell
npm install
```

Next we'll add the Apollo Federation library `@apollo/subgraph`:

```shell
npm install @apollo/subgraph
```

Open up `schema.graphql` and import the appropriate [Apollo Federation directives]. We will need the `@key` and `@shareable` directives:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
    import: ["@key", "@shareable"]
  )
```

Now we can make `Location` an entity with the `@key` and we'll use the `id` field as the key:

```graphql
type Location @key(fields:"id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  celestialBody: CelestialBody!
}
```

`CelestialBody` contains the coordinates of a specific location and we'll need to use that type in other places in our Supergraph. For shared types, we can denote this with the `@shareable` directive on the `CelestialBody` type. We'll also add `@shareable` to `Location.celestialBody`:

```graphql
type Location @key(fields:"id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  celestialBody: CelestialBody! @shareable
}

type CelestialBody @shareable {
  galaxy: String
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
}
```

That's it! Now we've upgraded our schema to expose `Location` as an entity ðŸŽ‰

Now the Planisphere is using the following schema:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(
    url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
    import: ["@key", "@shareable"]
  )

type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  celestialBody: CelestialBody! @shareable
}

type CelestialBody @shareable {
  galaxy: String
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
}

type Query {
  destinations: [Location]
}
```

With our schema modified, we'll need to create a **reference resolver** for the `Location` entity.

Open up `src/resolvers/Location.js`, this is where we'll define our `__resolveReference` resolver. If you look at `src/data/locations.js`, you'll see a `getLocation(id)` function that we'll want to use:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  Location: {
    __resolveReference(parent, context) {
      return context.locations.getLocation(parent.id);
    },
    async celestialBody(parent, args, context) {
      const location = await context.locations.getLocationCelestialBody(
        parent.id
      );
      return location.celestialBody;
    },
  },
};
```

The last step is to use the Apollo Federation library to build our schema.

Open `src/index.js` and modify the `ApolloServer` constructor to use `buildSubgraphSchema` instead of `typeDefs` and `resolvers` directly:

```javascript
const { buildSubgraphSchema } = require("@apollo/subgraph");

//...

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // .. existing options
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});
```

Now we can start up our upgraded monolith and add it to our Supergraph:

```shell
npm start
```

[rover] provides a way for you to build and develop your Supergraph stack locally.

In a new terminal window, try running `rover dev --url=http://localhost:4001 --name=start` and use the server you have running locally:

![rover dev](../images/start-rover-dev.png)

Now we have a graph router running locally and we can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to query our Supergraph:

```graphql
query AllLocations {
  destinations {
    name
    celestialBody {
      galaxy
      latitude
      longitude
    }
  }
}
```

After verifying everything is working locally, it's time to move to the cloud. We already have the Planisphere hosted for you at https://hack-the-supergraph-start-production.up.railway.app/.

Now head over to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) and let's create our Supergraph in the cloud:

![Create your supergraph](../../images/create-supergraph.png)

![Name your supergraph](../../images/name-new-supergraph.png)

>*We recommend giving this Supergraph an ID of **hack-the-supergraph-{surname}** to ensure you have a unique id. Make sure to copy the id of your Supergraph, we'll use it in other subgraph stations*

We can use the default `main` variant for this hackathon:

![](../../images/supergraph-variant.png)

Congrats, you just started your Supergraph! Now navigate to explorer and query all of the available locations:

```graphql
query AllLocations {
  destinations {
    name
    celestialBody {
      galaxy
      latitude
      longitude
    }
  }
}
```

Congratulations, you've completed the starting point of the hackathon! Head to any of the subgraph stations (*cosmic-cove*, *solar-seas* or *space-beach*) next.
