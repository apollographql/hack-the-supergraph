# Hack the Supergraph - Example Fullstack Supergraph

This repository contains an example of a Fullstack Supergraph with GraphOS. 

## üìñ Prerequisites

In order to run the project locally, you'll need `node>=14` installed on your development machines.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüïê Powered by [GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/) 

GraphOS automatically provisions and hosts a serverless cloud router for this example. Clients query the router instead of individual subgraphs, which enables the router to automatically collect operation metrics and usage data that you can then visualize in Apollo Studio.

Create your free serverless cloud router with GraphOS by signing up for free [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?from=%2F).

## üë©‚ÄçüöÄüöÄ‚ú® Exploring the Supergraph with Explorer, our GraphQL IDE  

GraphOS makes it possible to expose a public set of docs for your supergraph that anyone can use! Check out this [supergraph's example](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/hack-the-e-commerce/home?variant=main) and try running some queries.

You can create operation collections in the Apollo Studio Explorer, enabling you to save, organize, and share your frequently used GraphQL operations. There is an operation collection for the Website's grouped queries. 

## üåê Using @defer in a React App hosted on Netlify

[Deployed on Netlify, try `@defer`](https://hack-the-supergraph.netlify.app/product/product:1)

This fullstack application contains a simple React app that utilizes [`@apollo/client`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) to query GraphOS.

## üñ•Ô∏è Local development

If you would like to run the website locally, setup the website:

```sh
cd website
npm install
```

To start a local copy of the app on port 3000:

```sh
npm start
```

To debuge the instance, open VS Code and use the launch configuration available in the [Debug panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging):

```sh
code .
```

## Subgraphs

All of the subgraph projects are located in the `subgraphs` folder. There are currently five subgraphs: *orders*, *products*, *reviews*, *shipping*, *users*. Each subgraph is currently built with [`@apollo/server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) and hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/)

### GitHub Actions

All of the subgraphs in this example have GitHub Action workflows to interact with GraphOS. We created separate workflows to isolate each subgraphs tests and deploys. It was easy enough to do this using [paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-paths) for each subgrpah folder.

**This README**

We keep this repositories README in sync with GraphOS in case anyone visits our public Explorer referenced above. We are using the [Rover CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/readmes) to do this in this example, but you can also using the public [GraphOS Platform API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-platform/explorer?variant=main) if you want.

**Schema Checks**

Certain changes to your graph's schema (such as removing a field or type) might break one of your application's clients. GraphOS provides [schema checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-checks) to help you identify breaking changes before you make them, and to help you identify when a potentially dangerous change won't break anything.

To try out schema checks on this repository:

1. [Navigate to the products subgraph](subgraphs/products/schema.graphql)
2. Edit the file and remove the `mediaUrl` filed from the `Product` type
3. Create a new PR and commit
4. GitHub Actions will trigger in PR and fail due to schema checks

**Deploying Subgraph changes with Launches**

In GraphOS, a launch represents the complete process of making a set of updates to a supergraph, usually initiated by changes to one of its subgraphs. 

For this example we've kept it simple and have the minimum of what you want, keeping the `main` branch of this repository in sync with the `main` variant in GraphOS. Each variant of a supergraph has its own subgraph schemas, supergraph schema, change history, and metrics. You might have a staging or pre-production environment and that's exactly what variants are for!

### Deploy to Railway and GraphOS

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/fyuqlV?referralCode=xsbY2R)

You can easily deploy all of the subgraphs to Railway by clicking the button above‚Äîjust configure your first subgraph with the repo you want to clone this to, and click into the rest to accept the defaults. Once all of the subgraphs are deployed, create a new supergraph in GraphOS pointing to the `users` subgraph, then add new subgraphs in this order:

1. `reviews`
2. `products`
3. `orders`
4. `shipping`

Once your last deploy finishes in Studio, you can test it out by running a query like this:

```graphql

  fragment ProductFragment on Product {
    averageRating
    reviews {
      content
      rating
    }
  }
  query GetProductDetails {
    products {
      id
      title
      description
      mediaUrl
      ...ProductFragment @defer
    }
  }
```
