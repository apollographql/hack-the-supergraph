This repository contains an example of a Fullstack Supergraph with GraphOS. 

# Getting started

There are various ways to try out this example, whether you want to just try things out or run the fullstack app yourself.

## Trying out the Apollo Hosted Hack the Supergraph Example

We have everything in this fulsltack app hosted for you to try everything out. 

### Simple E-Commerce React App with `@defer`

The [`/website/` folder](website/) contains a simple e-commerce website that is built with React and `@apollo/client`. 

We have [this website hosted on Netlify](https://hack-the-supergraph.netlify.app/) and connected directly to this repo to deploy any changes to the `main` branch. 

### Exploring the Supergraph with Explorer, our GraphQL IDE

GraphOS makes it possible for you to use Explorer for anyone! Check out this [Supergraph's example](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/hack-the-e-commerce/home?variant=main) and try running some queries.

There is an operation collection for the Website's grouped queries.
